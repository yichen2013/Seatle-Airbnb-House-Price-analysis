Analysis the factors that affect on the Airbnb house price 
The file includes pre-processing data, price predicting model. 
The prediction model shows the most important features that affect on price are accomondation(house size), review, cancellation policy, zipcode(location).
First, I preprocessed the data, including clean up, change categrical varibles to dummy variables.
Second, I used linear-regression model and random forest model to predict the housing rent price. In the random forest model, I tuned the hyper-prameter by crossvalidation.
